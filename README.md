# CC2-Ecryption-Checker
Checks files from CyberConnect2 games using CC2's own engine for whether they're encrypted or not.

This tool was particularly built for use in ''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All-Star Battle R'' modding, so if you notice a file type from a CC2-engine game that isn't supported, please let me know!

## Usage Guide
To use this tool, simply drag the file onto the EXE. Your terminal will open and report whether the file is encrypted or not, as well as the container type the file uses (e.g. "NUCC").

Only the following files are supported with this tool. Those that are not will always be reported as encrypted.
- XFBIN
- DDS
- ACF
- NUS3CONF
- ACB
- AWB
- CPK
- EXE
